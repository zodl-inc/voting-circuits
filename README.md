# voting-circuits

Governance ZKP circuits (delegation, vote proof, share reveal) for the Zcash shielded-voting protocol.

Built with [Halo2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2) and
[`orchard`](https://github.com/zcash/orchard) through the Zakura package
family. The crate requires `std`.

## Proof flow

```
Ironwood Notes ──► Delegation (ZKP 1) ──► Vote Authority Notes (VANs)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                  Vote Proof  (ZKP 2) ──► Vote Commitments + encrypted shares
                                              │
                                              ▼
                  Share Reveal (ZKP 3) ──► Revealed shares for tally
```

1. [**Delegation**](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp1-delegation-proof) spends Ironwood V3 notes and mints VANs that carry delegated voting weight.
2. [**Vote Proof**](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp2-vote-proof) spends a VAN to cast a vote, producing El Gamal-encrypted shares and a vote commitment.
3. [**Share Reveal**](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp3-vote-reveal-proof) opens a single encrypted share and proves it belongs to a registered vote commitment.

## Usage

This crate is the circuit-only side. Wallets typically don't call it directly; they consume the higher-level [`zcash_voting`](https://github.com/valargroup/zcash_voting) crate which wraps proof generation, hotkey derivation, share construction, and the HTTP wire format.

If you do want the raw gadgets for a custom prover:

```rust
use voting_circuits::vote_proof::Circuit as VoteProofCircuit;
// ... assemble public/private inputs and run halo2_proofs
```

The default Zakura backend requires Rust 1.91. The alternate LRZ backend
supports Rust 1.86.

### Cryptography backend

The default features use Zakura's Orchard, Halo2, Pasta, and Sinsemilla
packages, so Zakura consumers use a plain dependency declaration.

LRZ consumers select the crates.io package family explicitly:

```toml
voting-circuits = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["lrz"] }
```

The default Zakura features and `lrz` are mutually exclusive. Disabling default
features without selecting `lrz` also fails to compile, so a build cannot
silently omit or combine backends.

Protocol domain-separation tags are registered in [`src/domain_tags.rs`](src/domain_tags.rs). Hash-owning modules document their own preimage layout, but new tags should be added to the registry first so the encoding rule and distinctness test stay centralized.

## Workspace crates

| Crate | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| `voting-circuits` | `./` | Delegation, vote-proof, and share-reveal circuits. |
| `voting-crypto-deps` | `voting-crypto-deps/` | Selectable Zakura and LRZ cryptography dependency facade. |
| `imt-tree` | `imt-tree/` | Indexed Merkle Tree for nullifier non-membership proofs: Poseidon hashing, punctured-range tree building, and exclusion proofs for the delegation circuit. Versioned independently; see [`imt-tree/CHANGELOG.md`](imt-tree/CHANGELOG.md). |

Each crate selects its cryptography backend the same way: the default
features select Zakura, and `lrz` (`upstream` for `imt-tree`) selects the
crates.io family.

### Shared gadgets (`circuit/`)

Reusable halo2 gadgets that appear in more than one circuit:

| Gadget | Used by | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `address_ownership` | Delegation, Vote Proof | CommitIvk + diversified-address binding |
| `elgamal` | Vote Proof | El Gamal encryption of vote shares |
| `poseidon_merkle` | All three | Poseidon Merkle-path membership proofs |
| `van_integrity` | Delegation, Vote Proof | Two-layer Poseidon hash for VAN commitments |
| `vote_commitment` | Vote Proof, Share Reveal | Hash of `(domain, round_id, shares_hash, proposal_id, decision)` |

`shares_hash` (at crate root) computes a two-level Poseidon hash over 16 blinded share commitments and is shared by ZKP 2 and ZKP 3.

### Circuit details

| Circuit | K | Rows | Conditions | Spec |
|---------|---|------|------------|------|
| Delegation | 12 | 4 096 | 15 | [ZKP #1](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp1-delegation-proof) |
| Vote Proof | 11 | 2 048 | 12 | [ZKP #2](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp2-vote-proof) |
| Share Reveal | 10 | 1 024 | 5 | [ZKP #3](https://valargroup.gitbook.io/shielded-vote-docs/zkp-specifications/zkp3-vote-reveal-proof) |

## Dependency on Orchard

The default backend uses the Zakura Orchard package. The opt-in LRZ backend
uses the API-compatible crates.io `orchard 0.15` release. Both enable the
`circuit` and `unstable-voting-circuits` features required by the governance proofs. The
delegation bundle builder requires Ironwood V3 notes and constructs its
synthetic signed and output notes as V3.

The V3 check is a bundle-construction policy, not a note-version bit in the
Halo2 statement. An Ironwood-only verifier must independently authenticate
`nc_root` as an Ironwood note commitment tree root and must not accept an
Orchard root supplied by the prover. It must authenticate `nf_imt_root` at the
same snapshot height.

## Building

```bash
cargo build
# LRZ backend
cargo build --no-default-features --features lrz
```

## Testing

Short-running tests are the default:

```bash
cargo test
# LRZ backend
cargo test --no-default-features --features lrz
```

Long-running tests are explicitly ignored and can be run when circuit-level coverage is needed. Skip the row-budget and cost-breakdown diagnostics for a normal regression pass:

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored --skip row_budget --skip cost_breakdown
```

To inspect circuit size diagnostics, keep `--nocapture` so the output is printed:

```bash
cargo test row_budget -- --ignored --nocapture
cargo test cost_breakdown -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The long tests are slow because they synthesize Halo 2 circuits and run
`MockProver` verification over the configured `K` domain (`delegation` uses
K=12, `vote_proof` uses K=11, and `share_reveal` uses K=10). Some gadget
stress tests are also long-running because they repeat many `MockProver`
checks, for example one K=12 shares-hash test runs 16 separate prover checks.
The real proof roundtrip also performs proving-key/proof generation and
verification, so it is intentionally outside the default unit-test path.

## Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench   # runs delegation proving benchmarks via Criterion
```

## Key dependencies
